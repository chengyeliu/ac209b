Starting A The End
==================

My goal: by the end of the workshop you will be able to reproduce this
graphic from the Economist:

![Economist graph](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/images/Economist1.png)

Why `ggplot2`? 
--------------

Advantages of ggplot2

-   consistent underlying `grammar of graphics` (Wilkinson, 2005)
-   plot specification at a high level of abstraction
-   very flexible
-   theme system for polishing plot appearance
-   mature and complete graphics system
-   many users, active mailing list

That said, there are some things you cannot (or should not) do With
ggplot2:

-   3-dimensional graphics (see the `plotly` or `rgl` packages)
-   Graph-theory type graphs (nodes/edges layout; see `igraph` or
    `ggnetwork`)
-   Interactive graphics (see `plotly` and/or `shiny`)

What Is The Grammar Of Graphics?
================================

The basic idea: independently specify plot building blocks and combine
them to create just about any kind of graphical display you want.
Building blocks of a graph include:

-   data
-   aesthetic mapping
-   geometric object
-   statistical transformations
-   scales
-   coordinate system
-   position adjustments
-   faceting

Example Data: `Housing prices`
------------------------------

Let's look at housing prices.

```{r}
housing <- read.csv("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/dataSets/landdata-states.csv")
head(housing[1:5])
```
(Data from
<https://www.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/land-prices-by-state.asp>)

`ggplot2` VS Base Graphics
--------------------------

Compared to base graphics, `ggplot2`

-   is more verbose for simple / canned graphics
-   is less verbose for complex / custom graphics
-   does not have methods (data should always be in a `data.frame`)
-   uses a different system for adding plot elements

`ggplot2` VS Base for simple graphs
-----------------------------------

Base graphics histogram example:

```{r}
hist(housing$Home.Value)
```

`ggplot2` histogram example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(housing, mapping = aes(x = Home.Value )) +
    geom_histogram()
```
Base wins!

`ggplot2` Base graphics VS `ggplot` for more complex graphs:
------------------------------------------------------------

Base colored scatter plot example:

```{r}
plot(Home.Value ~ Date, data=subset(housing, State == "MA"),
     type = "l")
lines(Home.Value ~ Date, col="red", data=housing[housing$State == "TX", ])
legend(1975, 400000,
       legend = c("MA", "TX"),
       title="State",
       col=c("black", "red"),
       pch=c(1, 1))
```

`ggplot2` colored scatter plot example:


```{r}
ggplot(housing[housing$State %in% c("MA", "TX"), ],
       mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Home.Value, color=State)) +
    geom_line()
```

`ggplot2` wins!


**NOTE** The remainder of the workshop focuses on `ggplot`, but you
should feel free to use whatever graphics methods you find most
convenient.

Geometric Objects And Aesthetics
================================

Aesthetic Mapping
-----------------

In `ggplot` land *aesthetic* means "something you can see". Examples
include:

-   position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
-   color ("outside" color)
-   fill ("inside" color)
-   shape (of points)
-   linetype
-   size

Each type of geom accepts only a subset of all aesthetics--refer to
the geom help pages to see what mappings each geom accepts. Aesthetic
mappings are set with the `aes()` function.

Geometic Objects (`geom`)
-------------------------

Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples
include:

-   points (`geom_point`, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
-   lines (`geom_line`, for time series, trend lines, etc)
-   boxplot (`geom_boxplot`, for, well, boxplots!)

A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can
add a geom to a plot using the `+` operator

You can get a list of available geometric objects using the code
below:

```{r}
help.search("geom_", package = "ggplot2")
```
or simply type `geom_<tab>` in any good R IDE (such as Rstudio or ESS)
to see a list of functions starting with `geom_`.

Points (Scatterplot)
--------------------

Now that we know about geometric objects and aesthetic mapping, we can
make a ggplot. `geom_point` requires mappings for x and y, all others
are optional. The documentation lists available aesthetic mappings for
each geom, with the required mappings in bold; see `?geom_point`.

```{r}
hp2001Q1 <- housing[housing$Date == 2001.25, ]

ggplot(hp2001Q1, mapping = aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = Land.Value)) +
    geom_point()
```

That's a good start, but we can see the relationship more clearly if
we spread out the x-axis values.

```{r}
hp2001Q1$log.Land.Value <- log(hp2001Q1$Land.Value)

ggplot(hp2001Q1, mapping = aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = log.Land.Value)) +
    geom_point()
```

Lines (Prediction Line)
-----------------------

A plot constructed with `ggplot` can have more than one geom. In that
case the mappings established in the `ggplot()` call are plot defaults
that can be added to or overridden. 

Our plot could use a regression line:

```{r}
hp2001Q1$pred.SC <- predict(lm(Structure.Cost ~ log.Land.Value,
                               data = hp2001Q1))

ggplot(hp2001Q1, mapping = aes(x = log.Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Home.Value)) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y = pred.SC))
```

Better, but clearly a linear regression line is not a good fit. Let's
try again.

```{r}
hp2001Q1$pred.SC <- predict(lm(Structure.Cost ~ poly(log.Land.Value, 3),
                               data = hp2001Q1))

p1 <- ggplot(hp2001Q1, mapping = aes(x = log.Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost))

p1 + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Home.Value)) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y = pred.SC))
```


Smoothers
---------

Not all geometric objects are simple shapes--the smooth geom includes
a line and a ribbon. It also does the `stat`istical transformation for
us. We'll talk more about statistical transformations shortly.


```{r}
p1 + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Home.Value)) + geom_smooth()
```

Text (Label Points)
-------------------

Each `geom` accepts a particualar set of mapping. The Required and
optional aesthetic mappings are documented for each `geom_*` function.

for example, `geom_text()` is the only one that accepts a `labels`
mapping.

```{r}
p1 + geom_text(mapping = aes(label=State), size = 3)
```

Notice how ME, WI, and ID all overlap? There is nothing in `ggplot2`
proper that will fix that for us, but the `ggprepel` package will
adjust the labels for us. Other `ggplot` helper packages are described
at <http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/>.

```{r}
## install.packages("ggrepel")
library("ggrepel")
p1 +
    geom_point() + geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label=State), size = 3)
```

Aesthetic Mapping VS Assignment
-------------------------------

Note that variables are mapped to aesthetics with the `aes()`
function, while fixed aesthetics are set outside the `aes()` call.
This sometimes leads to confusion, as in this example:

```{r}
p1 + geom_point(mapping = aes(size = 2),# incorrect! 2 is not a variable
  color="red") # this is fine -- all points red
```

Statistical Transformations
===========================

Some plot types (such as scatterplots) do not require
transformations--each point is plotted at x and y coordinates equal to
the original value. Other plots, such as boxplots, histograms,
prediction lines etc. require statistical transformations:

-   for a boxplot the y values must be transformed to the median and
    1.5(IQR)
-   for a smoother smother the y values must be transformed into
    predicted values

Each `geom` has a default statistic, but these can be changed. For
example, the default statistic for `geom_bar` is `stat_bin`:

```{r}
args(geom_histogram)
args(stat_bin)
```

Setting Statistical Transformation Arguments
--------------------------------------------

Arguments to `stat_` functions can be passed through `geom_`
functions.

For example, here is the default histogram of Home.Value:

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(housing, mapping = aes(x = Home.Value))
p2 +
    geom_histogram()
```

The binwidth looks reasonable by default, but we can change it by
passing the `binwidth` argument to the `stat_bin` function:

```{r}
p2 + geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth=4000)
```

Changing The Statistical Transformation
---------------------------------------

Sometimes the default statistical transformation is not what you need.
This is often the case with pre-summarized data:

```{r, error = TRUE}
housing.sum <- aggregate(housing["Home.Value"],  housing["State"], FUN=mean)

rbind(head(housing.sum),
      tail(housing.sum))

ggplot(housing.sum, mapping = aes(x=State, y=Home.Value)) +
    geom_bar() 
```

What is the problem with the previous plot? Basically we take binned
and summarized data and ask ggplot to bin and summarize it again
(remember, `geom_bar` defaults to `stat_count`); obviously this will
not work. We can fix it by telling `geom_bar` to use a different
statistical transformation function:

```{r}
ggplot(housing.sum, mapping = aes(x=State, y=Home.Value)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

The Big Picture
---------------

One of the core insights of the grammar of graphics is that the
building blocks are swap-able. While each `geom` has a default
transformation, we can use any `geom`/`stat` combination we like. This
gives us a very flexible system that can be used to construct wide
variety of different statistical graphs.

Note also that there are always two ways to do statistical
transformations: using (perhaps by default) one of the `stat_`
functions from the `ggplot2` package, or using the rest of R to do the
transformation yourself. There is no right or wrong way; often letting
`ggplot` do it for you is more convenient, but if not just do it
yourself and give `ggplot` the transformed values.


Scales: Controlling Aesthetic Mapping
=====================================

Aesthetic mapping (i.e., with `aes()`) only says that a variable
should be mapped to an aesthetic. It doesn't say *how* that should
happy. For example, when mapping a variable to *shape* with `aes(shape
` x)= you don't say *what* shapes should be used. Similarly,
`aes(color ` z)= doesn't say *what* colors should be used. Describing
what colors/shapes/sizes etc. to use is done by modifying the
corresponding *scale*. In `ggplot2` scales include

-   position
-   color and fill
-   size
-   shape
-   line type

Scales are modified with a series of functions using a
`scale_<aesthetic>_<type>` naming scheme. Try typing `scale_<tab>` to
see a list of scale modification functions.

Common Scale Arguments
----------------------

The following arguments are common to most scales in ggplot2:

name  
the first argument gives the axis or legend title

limits  
the minimum and maximum of the scale

breaks  
the points along the scale where labels should appear

labels  
the labels that appear at each break

Specific scale functions may have additional arguments; for example,
the `scale_color_continuous` function has arguments `low` and `high`
for setting the colors at the low and high end of the scale.

Scale Modification Examples
---------------------------

Start by constructing a dotplot showing the distribution of home
values by Date and State.

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(housing, mapping = aes(x = State, y = Home.Price.Index)) +
    theme(legend.position="top", axis.text=element_text(size = 6))

(p4 <- p3 +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Date),
                alpha = 0.5,
                size = 1.5,
                position = position_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0)))
```

Now modify the breaks and labels for the x axis and color scales

```{r}
p4 +
    scale_x_discrete(name="State Abbreviation") +
    scale_color_continuous(name="",
                           limits = c(1974, 2014),
                           breaks = c(1975, 1994, 2013),
                           labels = c("'75", "'94", "'13"))
```

Next change the low and high values to blue and red:

```{r}
p4 +
    scale_x_discrete(name="State Abbreviation") +
    scale_color_continuous(name="",
                           limits = c(1974, 2014),
                           breaks = c(1975, 1994, 2013),
                           labels = c("'75", "'94", "'13"),
                           low = "blue",
                           high = "red")
```

Using different color scales
----------------------------

ggplot2 has a wide variety of color scales; here is an example using
`scale_color_gradient2` to interpolate between three different colors.

```{r}
p4 +
    scale_color_gradient2(name="",
                          limits = c(1974, 2014),
                          breaks = c(1975, 1994, 2013),
                          labels = c("'75", "'94", "'13"),
                          low = "blue",
                          high =  "red",
                          mid = "gray60",
                          midpoint = 1994)
```

Note that in RStudio you can type `scale_` followed by TAB to get the
whole list of available scales.

The Big Picture
---------------

We've used the color scales as an example, but the general idea
applies to all aesthetics. We establish a mapping using `mapping =
aes(...)`, and then specify how that mapping should be instantiated
using the `scale` functions.

Faceting
========

Faceting is `ggplot2` parlance for **small multiples**. The idea is to
create separate graphs for subsets of data `ggplot2` offers two
functions for creating small multiples:

1.  `facet_wrap()`: define subsets as the levels of a single grouping
        variable
2.  `facet_grid()`: define subsets as the crossing of two grouping
        variables 

Faceting avoids over plotting and facilitates comparison among plots.


What is the trend in housing prices in each state?
--------------------------------------------------

Start by using a technique we already know--map State to color:

```{r}
p5 <- ggplot(housing, mapping = aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value))
p5 + geom_line(mapping = aes(color = State))  
```

There are two problems here--there are too many states to distinguish
each one by color, and the lines obscure one another (over-plotting).

Faceting to the rescue
----------------------

We can remedy the deficiencies of the previous plot by faceting by
state rather than mapping state to color.

```{r}
(p5 <- p5 + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 10))
```

There is also a `facet_grid()` function for faceting in two
dimensions.

Themes
======

The `ggplot2` theme system handles non-data plot elements such as

-   Axis labels
-   Plot background
-   Facet label backround
-   Legend appearance

Built-in themes include:

-   `theme_gray()` (default)
-   `theme_bw()`
-   `theme_classic()`

Additional themes can be found in various extension packages --
see <http://www.ggplot2-exts.org>.

```{r}
p4 + theme_linedraw()
```

```{r}
p4 + theme_light()
```

Overriding theme defaults
-------------------------

Specific theme elements can be overridden using `theme()`. For
example:

```{r}
p4 + theme_minimal() +
    theme(text = element_text(color = "turquoise"))
```

All theme options are documented in `?theme`.

Creating and saving new themes
------------------------------

You can create new themes, as in the following example:

```{r}
theme_new <- theme_bw() +
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(size = 1, color = "blue", fill = "black"),
          text = element_text(size = 12, family = "Serif", color = "maroon"),
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "purple"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "red"),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill = "orange"))

  p4 + theme_new
```

The \#1 FAQ: How to Map Aesthetic to Different Columns
=====================================================

The most frequently asked question goes something like this: *I have
two variables in my data.frame, and I'd like to plot them as separate
points, with different color depending on which variable it is. How do
I do that?*

### Wrong

Just plotting separate lines is not good because we don't get a legend.

```{r}
housing.byyear <- aggregate(cbind(Home.Value, Land.Value) ~ Date,
                            data = housing, mean)

ggplot(housing.byyear, mapping = aes(x=Date)) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y=Home.Value), color="red") +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y=Land.Value), color="blue")
```

### Right

There are two ways to go about it. The recommended way is to re-shape
your data so that every variable is represented in a single column.
The quick-and-dirty way is to abuse the layers system.


Quick and dirty:

```{r}
ggplot(housing.byyear, mapping = aes(x = Date)) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y = Home.Value, color = "Home.Value")) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(y = Land.Value, color = "Land.Value")) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "value type")
```

Recommended: Reshape and then plot as usual.

```{r}
## install.packages(tidyr)
library(tidyr)
home.land.byyear <- gather_(housing.byyear,
                           value = "value",
                           key = "type",
                           gather_cols = c("Home.Value", "Land.Value"))
ggplot(home.land.byyear,
       mapping = aes(x=Date,
           y=value,
           color=type)) +
  geom_line()
```


Your turn: Recreate This `Economist` Graph
=========================================

![Economist graph](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/images/Economist1.png)

Graph source: <http://www.economist.com/node/21541178>

These data consist of *Human Development Index* (**HDI**) and
*Corruption Perception Index* (**CPI**) scores for several countries.

Original sources for these data are
<http://www.transparency.org/content/download/64476/1031428> <http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/display_cf_xls_indicator.cfm?indicator_id=103106&lang=en>


Part 1: Load data and construct basic plot
--------------------------------------------

The data for the exercises is available in
the <http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/dataSets/EconomistData.csv>
file.


Using `ggplot`;

1. Read the data into R, assigning the result to the name `econ.data`.
2.  Create a scatter plot with CPI on the x axis and HDI on the y
    axis.
3.  Color the points in the previous plot according to *Region*.
4. Add a prediction line. Don't worry about the accuracy of the
   predictions (yet)


Part 2: Smoothing line
----------------------
1.  Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot you
    constructed in the last exercise. Us the *lm* method with a
    `degree = 5` polynomial. Hint: see `?stat_smooth`.
2.  Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using
    `geom_line`. Tell `geom_line` to use the `loess` method.
3.  I don't know for sure what model was used to create the original,
    but a linear model predicting `HDI` from `CPI + log(CPI)` looks
    pretty close. Use `stat_smooth` to add a prediction line based on
    this model.
4.  (Advanced). Overlay a smoothing line using predictions from a `gam` model with
    a smoothing parameter of 0.2 that includes a shaded confidence interval.
5. (Advanced). Overlay a smoothing line but use error bars instead of
   a ribbon to display the confidence interval.

Part 3: Aesthetic Mapping and Scales
-----------------------------------

1.  Modify the x, y, and color scales so that they have more
    easily-understood names (e.g., spell out "Human development Index"
    instead of "HDI").
2.  Modify the color scale to use one of the <http://colorbrewer.org>
    color scales.
3.  Modify the color scale to use specific values of your choosing.
    Hint: see `?scale_color_manual`.

Part 4: Finishing touches
-------------------------

Use the theme system, `ggplot` helper packages, and any other
resources at your disposal to make your graph look as closer to the
original. Don't get carried away, no need to spend all night on it.
Take this as an opportunity to learn the theme system.

Part 5: Make it better
----------------------

Identify at least one way in which the graphic can be improved and
implement that improvement in `ggplot2`.
